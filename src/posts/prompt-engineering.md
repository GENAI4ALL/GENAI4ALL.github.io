## What is Prompt Engineering?
Prompt engineering is about creating and improving instructions (called prompts) to help computer programs understand and do what you want. It's about knowing what the program can do and giving clear, smart instructions to get the best answers or results. This is really important for things like making computer-generated art or talking robots, because how well you ask determines how good the computer's work is.

## How to Prompt Effectively?
OpenAI has their own [prompt engineering guide](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering/prompt-engineering), including six strategies and quite a few [tactics](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering/tactics):
1. [Write clear instructions](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering/write-clear-instructions)
2. [Provide reference text](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering/provide-reference-text) 
3. [Split complex tasks into simpler subtasks](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering/split-complex-tasks-into-simpler-subtasks)
4. [Give the model time to "think"](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering/give-the-model-time-to-think)
5. [Use external tools](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering/use-external-tools)
6. [Test changes systematically](https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/prompt-engineering/test-changes-systematically)
